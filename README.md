# ClientServerCommunication

Final project for networking course CS372 at Oregon State University. 

Facilitates a socket communication between a server and a client. Communication has the server and the client send messages in turns. To indicate turns, an input is opened and displays a ‘>’ to indicate the input is open to either the server or the client. Either user can close the connection with a '/q' message.
